## INGREDIENTS
* ½ cup butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1½ cups all-purpose flour
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¾ tablespoon baking powder
* ½ cup milk
* 1 tablespoon Earl Grey tea *pulverized*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a bowl (or with a stand mixer), beat the butter until creamy. Add the sugar and cream the butter with the sugar until it is light and fluffy.
2. Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder together.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each egg very well so that it is thoroughly combined before adding the next egg.
4. Beat in half of the flour mixture along with the tea. Then add the milk and the remaining flour mixture, stirring until just combined.
5. Fill the cupcake pans ⅔ full. Bake 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through to ensure even baking. Cool thoroughly before frosting.
6. Frost with [Fluffy Orange Honey Frosting](/fluffy-orange-honey-frosting). (Or try a lemon buttercream or lavender.)
