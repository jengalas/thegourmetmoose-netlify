## INGREDIENTS
* 3 cups (390 g) all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* water mixed with eggs, to make 1 cup
* 1 teaspoon oil

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Mix all ingredients with dough hook until combined.
2. Divide dough into two halves and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes.
3. Roll out one half, sprinkling liberally with flour so it doesn't stick, to desired thickness (between 1/16" - 1/8").
4. Roll dough sheet lengthwise, cut on alternating diagonals into approximately ½" wide noodles, and separate. Spread out onto foil-lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and freeze. Repeat with remaining half of dough.
5. Once the noodles <span style='display: none;'>moodles</span> are frozen, remove from the baking sheets and place into gallon-size freezer bag, and return to freezer.
