excerpt: "This recipe is based on one from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/rosemary-potato-rolls-recipe). I have tried making this recipe in the King Arthur hamburger bun pan with excellent results. I make about two-thirds of the original recipe (quantities I use are given below). If fresh rosemary is sparse, it works to make a tea by steeping about ½ teaspoon of chopped rosemary in the water, then adding the rosemary along with ½ teaspoon of dried rosemary to the dry ingredients. Other spices work as well, such as Herbes de Provence."

## INGREDIENTS
* 190g warm water
* 1½ teaspoons instant yeast
* 4 teaspoons (25g) olive oil
* 245g all-purpose flour
* 12g dry milk or nonfat dry milk powder
* 30g potato flour or dried potato flakes
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary *optional*
* ⅔ teaspoon salt

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm water, yeast, and olive oil. Whisk to combine.
2. In a large bowl, whisk the dry milk and potato flour into the all-purpose flour.
3. Add the flour mixture to the bowl of the stand mixer. Add remaining ingredients and mix until a soft dough forms.
4. Knead at low speed in the mixer for about 8 minutes, until the dough is satiny and springs back when poked.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour, until almost doubled.
6. After the first rise, divide the dough into 6 portions (about 81-84g each), shape into rolls and place in the lightly buttered wells of the bun pan. 
7. Let rise for 45 minutes (about 35 minutes in the oven with the light on, then remove and continue to rise for 10 minutes on the counter while the oven is heating). While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.
8. Brush with light egg wash and bake for 14 minutes, until golden brown.
