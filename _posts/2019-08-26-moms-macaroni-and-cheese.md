## INGREDIENTS
* 1 pound elbow macaroni
* salted water
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 6 tablespoons flour
* 3 cups milk
* 1½ teaspoons salt
* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 2 teaspoons dry mustard
* few dashes Tabasco sauce
* 2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese
* 2 eggs _beaten_
* dried breadcrumbs _for topping_

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Bring a large pot filled with salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook just until tender. Drain and set aside.
3. In a saucepan melt the butter and whisk in flour. Cook a few minutes, taking care not to brown the flour.
4. Off the heat stir in the milk, salt, cayenne pepper, mustard, and Tabasco. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. When the sauce thickens, simmer several minutes longer.
5. Off the heat stir in the cheese. When the sauce has cooled slightly, add the eggs and mix well.
6. Layer half of the macaroni in a buttered baking dish. Top with half of the sauce. Repeat layers. Sprinkle top with bread crumbs and bake 30 minutes, or until the top is brown and sauce is hot.
