Sprinkle pecans over pineapple; set aside.
3. In a small bowl with clean beaters, beat egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form.

5. Fold egg whites into batter. Spoon into pan.
6. Bake 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before inverting onto serving plate.
