## INGREDIENTS
* 2 cups dried apricots
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* 1½ tablespoons amaretto or fresh lemon juice


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place apricots in medium saucepan, cover with water, and simmer about 10-15 minutes until apricots are soft.
2. Drain the apricots, reserving about 1 tablepoon of the liquid.
3. Put the apricots into a food processor with the other ingredients, and puree. Add some of the reserved liquid if the mixture seems too stiff to be spreadable.
4. About half of this recipe works well for me to make 6 buns with half of the Basic Sweet Dough recipe. I roll the dough to a 9"x18" rectangle, spread on the filling, fold in thirds, and slice into 6 strips. Twist the strips like for cardamom buns and bake in the buttered wells of the bun pan for 16-17 minutes at 375°F.
