excerpt: "These are large, soft rolls that bake to a beautiful golden brown (mine take 14 minutes). The recipe is an adaptation of [Soft Dinner Rolls](https://www.joyofbaking.com/breads/SoftDinnerRolls.html) from JoyofBaking.com. Most of the directions are the same, but I've scaled it down to make 6 rolls instead of 12, and I bake them in a hamburger bun pan."

## INGREDIENTS
### Sponge
* 58g unbleached bread flour
* pinch instant yeast
* 36g cold water

### Rolls
* 173g unbleached bread flour
* 2g instant yeast
* 4g kosher salt
* 14g granulated white sugar
* 12g dried milk powder
* 92g cold water
* ½ large egg (26g)
* 35g unsalted butter *room temperature*

## INSTRUCTIONS
### Sponge
1. In a medium sized bowl, stir the flour with the yeast. 
2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the water. With a plastic scraper or wooden spoon, work the flour into the liquid, until all the flour has been moistened. 
3. Place into a medium sized container that has been lightly oiled, cover, and let it ferment at room temperature for 12-14 hours.

### Rolls
1. In a large bowl stir the flour with the yeast, salt, sugar, and dried milk powder.
2. Pour the cold water into the bowl of your electric stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook. Then add the Sponge, the egg, and the flour mixture. Knead the dough on 1st speed for 5 minutes. Increase your mixer speed to 2nd speed and continue to knead the dough for about 3 minutes or until the dough cleans the bowl and is smooth, elastic, and a little sticky. Add the butter and continue to knead the dough, on 2nd speed, for another 6-7 minutes or until the dough cleans the bowl and is smooth and elastic. The dough will be a little sticky.
3. Place your dough in a large bowl that has been lightly oiled. Turn the dough once so the top of the dough has a light coating of oil (this prevents a crust from forming on the top of the dough). Cover with plastic wrap and let ferment at room temperature (about 75°F/24°C) for one hour.
4. Turn out your dough onto a lightly floured surface. You want the top of the dough to now be on the bottom. Lightly flour the top of your dough and with the palms of your hands flatten the dough slightly to break any large air bubbles.
5. Then divide the dough into 6 equal pieces (about 75 grams each). When you divide the dough use a pastry scraper or knife and cut, don't pull or stretch, the dough.
6. Then, working with one piece of dough at a time, pre-shape your dough into a ball. With the palms of your hands rotate the ball of dough on an unfloured surface to create surface tension and to seal the edges of the dough completely. Place the rounds on a floured baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Let the rounds of dough sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. (This is to relax the dough and you will notice that the dough will rise a little.)
7. Next, place the rounds of dough, upside down, onto a lightly floured surface. Working with one piece of dough at a time, flatten the dough into a round, breaking any air bubbles. Next, take the edges of the dough and fold them into the center and gently seal. Then flip your dough over so the smooth side is facing up. With the palm of your hand rotate the ball of dough on your unfloured surface to create surface tension and to seal the edges of the dough completely.
8. Place the rolls on your baking sheet or in a bun pan, spacing several inches apart. Cover the pan with plastic wrap that has been lightly oiled or sprayed with a non stick vegetable spray and let proof at room temperature for about 1½ hours. (If you lightly press into the dough, your finger will leave a slight indentation.)
9. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 400°F/200°C.
10. When your rolls are ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap. Make an egg wash by whisking egg yolk with cream, milk, or water. With a pastry brush, lightly brush the rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds (if desired). Bake for about 14 - 16 minutes or until your rolls are golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The rolls can be stored in an airtight bag for about three days or can be frozen for a couple of months.
