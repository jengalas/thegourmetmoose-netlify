## INGREDIENTS
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* ¾ cup butter _softened_
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour
* 12 ounces fresh cranberries

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. With a mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar until slightly thickened and light in color, about 5-7 minutes. The mixture should almost double in size. The eggs work as your leavening agent in this recipe, so do not skip this step. This mixture should form a ribbon when you lift the beaters out of the bowl.
2. Add the butter and vanilla; mix two more minutes.
3. Stir in the flour until just combined.
4. Add the cranberries and stir to mix throughout.
5. Spread in a buttered 9x13-inch pan. Bake for around 40 minutes, or until very lightly browned and a toothpick inserted near the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool completely before cutting into small slices.
