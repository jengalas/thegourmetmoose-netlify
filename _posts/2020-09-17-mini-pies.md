excerpt: "We baked these for 25 minutes (they were bubbling nicely), then turned off the oven and left them in there for another 3 minutes or so. We also moved the oven rack up one notch from where I usually have it, and placed a piece of foil on the rack underneath to catch drips."

## INGREDIENTS
* 1 15-ounce can cherry pie filling
* 1 prepared pie crust, enough for a 2-crust 9-inch pie


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Cut rounds to fit the mini (5-inch) pie pans. We were able to get three bottom and full top crusts.
3. Fill with pie filling, cover with top crust and seal. Cut a slit in the top to vent.
4. Bake 25-30 minutes.
