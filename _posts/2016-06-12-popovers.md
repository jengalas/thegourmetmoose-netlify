excerpt: "We use a hand mixer and blend the ingredients in a 4-cup measuring cup rather than using a food processor or blender. It works just as well and makes for easier filling of the popover cups! Room temperature ingredients work best. Leave eggs and milk out of refrigerator for several hours before beginning to make the popovers."
