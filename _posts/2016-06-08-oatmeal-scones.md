excerpt: "For variations, try adding ½ cup of chopped dried apricots or cherries (or other dried fruit) along with the cooled oats. Another excellent combination is ½ cup dried cranberries, and ¾ teaspoon of orange oil added to the milk, cream, and egg mixture."

## INGREDIENTS
* 4½ ounces old fashioned rolled oats
* ¼ cup milk
* ¼ cup heavy cream
* 1 large egg
* 7½ ounces all-purpose flour
* 2¼ ounces sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 10 tablespoons unsalted butter *cold, cut into ½-inch cubes*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat to 375°F. Spread oats evenly on baking sheet and toast in oven until fragrant and lightly browned, about 7-9 minutes; cool on wire rack. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Line second baking sheet with parchment paper. When oats are cool, measure out two tablespoons and set aside.
2. Whisk milk, cream and egg in large measuring cup until incorporated; remove 1 tablespoon to small bowl and reserve for glazing.
3. Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor until combined, about four 1-second pulses. Scatter cold butter evenly over dry ingredients and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 12-14 1-second pulses. Transfer mixture to medium bowl; stir in cooled oats. Using rubber spatula, fold in liquid ingredients until large clumps form. Mix dough by hand (I recommend using gloves) in bowl until dough forms cohesive mass.
4. Dust work surface with half of reserved oats, turn dough out, and dust top with remaining oats. Pat into 1-inch-thick circle and cut into 8 wedges. Place on baking sheet (or use buttered scone pan if available). Brush surfaces with reserved egg mixture. Bake until golden brown, 12-14 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool to room temperature.
