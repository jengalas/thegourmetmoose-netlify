excerpt: "This recipe is based on the [Cranberry Orange Bread](https://www.joyofbaking.com/breakfast/CranberryOrangeBread.html) recipe at JoyOfBaking.com. It's semi-moist, tart and slightly sweet, and easy to make (but I recommend getting as many ingredients ready ahead of time as possible). And be careful chopping the cranberries!"

## INGREDIENTS
* ½ cup (50 grams) pecans, walnuts, or almonds
* 1 cup (120 grams) fresh or frozen cranberries *coarsely chopped*
* 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 cup (200 grams) granulated white sugar
* 1½ teaspoons (6 grams) baking powder
* ½ teaspoon (2 grams) baking soda
* ½ teaspoon (2 grams) salt
* 1 tablespoon (5 grams) finely grated orange zest
* 4 tablespoons (55 grams) cold unsalted butter *cut into pieces*
* 1 large egg *at room temperature*
* ¾ cup (180 ml/grams) freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat your oven to 350° F (180° C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Butter, or spray with a nonstick vegetable spray, a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.
2. If the nuts aren't already roasted, place them on a baking sheet and toast for about 6 to 8 minutes or until lightly brown and fragrant. Let cool and then chop coarsely.
3. In a large bowl, whisk the flour with the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest.
4. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. (The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.)
5. Fold in the chopped nuts and cranberries.
6. In a bowl, whisk the egg until frothy. Whisk in the orange juice and vanilla extract. 
7. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. 
8. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with the back of a spoon or offset spatula. 
9. Bake for about 55-60 minutes (mine takes 52-53) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. 
10. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. Then remove the bread from the pan and let cool completely. This bread is best if stored overnight before serving. It can also be frozen.
