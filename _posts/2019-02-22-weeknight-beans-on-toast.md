## INGREDIENTS
* 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 lb. sweet sausage or hot Italian sausage _casings removed_
* 3 large cloves garlic _minced_
* ½ tsp. dried oregano
* ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
* 1 tsp. salt
* ¼ tsp. ground black pepper
* 1 cup chicken stock or water
* 1 5-oz. package baby spinach _coarsely chopped_
* 2 15.5-oz. cans navy or cannelloni beans _drained_

### For serving
* Crusty Italian sub rolls, ciabatta rolls, or baguette
* Butter
* Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese _optional_
* Chopped parsley _optional_

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Heat oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
2. Add sausage, breaking apart with a heat-proof spatula, and cook until browned.  Drain excess liquid and grease.
3. Add garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and continue cooking until garlic just begins to turn light brown, about 1 minute.
4. Carefully add tomatoes, chicken stock (or water), salt, pepper.  
5. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 10-12 minutes.
6. Mix in spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. (An 8-oz. package is OK if you prefer a bit more spinach.)
7. Add beans and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.
8. Split the sub rolls or bread lengthwise, toast under broiler or in toaster oven, and butter lightly.  Ladle a generous portion of ragù over rolls and top with grated cheese and parsley.
