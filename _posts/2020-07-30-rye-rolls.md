## INGREDIENTS
* 3 ounces rye flour
* 5 ounces bread flour
* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds or powder _optional_
* ¾ cup water
* ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a large bowl, stir together the first three ingredients. Pour the water over the top and sprinkle the yeast over the water. Then sprinkle the sugar over the yeast. Stir just a little bit without incorporating much of the flour. Let it sit for a few minutes.
2. After the yeast is softened, add the salt and mix the dough vigorously with a strong spoon or spatula for a couple of minutes.
3. Cover the dough and let rest/rise overnight. If your kitchen is cool, it can sit at room temperature the whole time, but if it's warm, put it in the refrigerator after an hour or so.
4. Form into rolls (I made 5) and bake in a hamburger bun pan at 425°F for 15 minutes.
