excerpt: "Rich has been asking for some slightly soft & chewy, slightly oaty cookies with macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips. We purchased some chopped macadamia nuts and organic white chocolate chunks from Nuts.com, and then I started looking for a recipe. This recipe is based on the [Oatmeal Cookie](https://www.joyofbaking.com/OatmealCookies.html) recipe at JoyofBaking.com. I halved the original recipe, added a little less oats and a little more flour, and skipped the cinnamon and dried fruit. I used seagrape honey, but that's very hard to find outside of Florida—any dark, caramelly honey should work well. These were a hit!"

## INGREDIENTS
* 85 grams unsalted butter
* 85 grams light brown sugar _firmly packed_
* ½ egg (about 25-30 grams) _at room temperature_
* 1½ teaspoons honey
* ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 60 grams all purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon baking soda
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 90-95 grams quick-cooking oats
* 60 grams chopped macadamia nuts
* 65 grams white chocolate chips


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat your oven to 350° F (180° C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone lining sheets. 
2. In the bowl of your electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment (or with a hand mixer), beat the butter until smooth. 
3. Add the sugar and beat until creamy and smooth (about 1-2 minutes). 
4. Add the egg, honey, and vanilla extract and beat to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. 
5. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and beat until incorporated. Then stir in the oats, nuts, and white chocolate chips. 
6. For large cookies, use 1/8 cup (28 grams) of batter (I like to use a #30 cookie scoop to form the cookies) and space the cookies about 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. Then lightly wet your hand and flatten the cookies slightly with your fingers. 
7. Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes or until golden brown around the edges but still soft and look a little wet in the center. 
8. Remove from oven and place the baking sheet on a wire rack. Let the cookies cool a few minutes on the baking sheet so they firm up, before transferring them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
