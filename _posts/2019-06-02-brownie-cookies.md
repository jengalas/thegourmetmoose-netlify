## INGREDIENTS
* ¼ cup (35 grams) all purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon (1 gram) baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon (1 gram) salt
* 8 ounces (225 grams) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate _coarsely chopped_
* 2½ tablespoons (35 grams) butter _cut into small chunks_
* ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon (115 grams) granulated white sugar
* 2 large (100 grams) eggs _room temperature_
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup (170 grams) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips or chopped nuts _optional_

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Sift or whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. Melt the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl (preferably stainless steel), placed over a saucepan of simmering water.
4. Remove from heat and whisk in the sugar and vanilla extract.
5. Next, whisk in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
6. Finally, stir in the flour mixture and chocolate chips. If the batter is really soft, cover and place in the refrigerator until firm.
7. Drop batter by heaping tablespoons onto your prepared cookie sheets, spacing several inches apart (7.5 cm). Bake cookies for about 10 minutes or just until set around the edges, but the centers are still soft. Do not overbake these cookies or they will be dry.
8. Remove from oven and place the baking sheet on a wire rack to cool for about five minutes before transferring the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.

These cookies are best the day they are baked but can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for three to four days. They can also be frozen.
