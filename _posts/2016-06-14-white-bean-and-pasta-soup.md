## INGREDIENTS
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* ¾ cup baby carrots *sliced, about ⅛-inch thick*
* ¾ cup celery *sliced, about ⅛-inch thick*
* 1½ cups onions *chopped; about one medium-large onion*
* 3 cloves garlic *minced*
* 3 cups water *more as needed*
* 2 19-ounce cans cannellini beans *with liquid*
* 1 large tomato *seeds removed, coarsely chopped*
* ½ teaspoon dried sage leaf flakes *or about ¼ ounce fresh sage leaves, finely chopped*
* 1½ teaspoons salt
* ½ teaspoon black pepper *ground*
* 1 heaping cup small pasta *e.g. farfalline*
* ½ cup green onions *chopped; use mostly the dark green tops*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Heat olive oil in a heavy large pot over medium heat. Lightly sauté the carrots and celery for 10 minutes. Add onions and garlic, then continue to sauté about 5 minutes more.
2. Add 3 cups water, beans with the liquid, tomatoes, sage, salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 25 minutes to blend the flavors, stirring occasionally. Mix in the pasta and bring to a light boil. Cook until pasta is tender but still firm to bite, about 12 minutes, adding more water to the soup by ½ cupfuls if it gets very thick. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
3. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with chopped green onion tops and serve with crusty bread and salad. Makes about 6 servings.
