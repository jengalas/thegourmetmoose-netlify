excerpt: "An enameled cast-iron Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid yields best results, but the recipe also works in a regular cast-iron Dutch oven or heavy stockpot. Use a mild-flavored lager. The bread is best eaten the day it is baked but can be wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a cool, dry place for up to 2 days. Our modifications to time and temp: preheat oven to 500°F, put bread in and immediately reduce temp to 400°F, bake covered for 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake up to 5 more minutes."

## INGREDIENTS
* 10 ounces unbleached all-purpose flour *plus additional for dusting work surface*
* 5 ounces whole wheat (or white whole wheat) flour
* 2 tablespoons honey
* ¼ teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast
* 1½ teaspoons table salt
* 7 ounces (¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons) water *at room temperature*
* 3 ounces (¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons) mild-flavored lager
* 1 tablespoon white vinegar

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Whisk flours, yeast, and salt in large bowl. Dissolve honey in water, then add to dry ingredients with beer and vinegar. Using rubber spatula, fold mixture, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl until shaggy ball forms. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12- by 18-inch sheet of parchment paper inside 10-inch skillet and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle. Transfer dough, seam side down, to parchment-lined skillet and spray surface of dough with nonstick cooking spray. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger, about 2 hours.
3. About 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place 6- to 8-quart heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (with lid) on rack, and heat oven to 500°F. Lightly flour top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 6-inch-long, ½-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 425°F and bake covered for 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 210°F, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.
