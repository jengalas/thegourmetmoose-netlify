## INGREDIENTS
* 18 ounces all-purpose flour
* 2¼ teaspoons instant yeast
* ⅓ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup milk
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 3 large egg yolks

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix briefly just to combine. Add the milk and butter to a small saucepan and set over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the butter has melted and the mixture registers about 115°F on an instant-read thermometer.
2. Add the warm milk/butter mixture to the mixer bowl along with the egg yolks. Mix on low speed until a rough dough comes together (you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice to get everything incorporated). Knead the dough on low speed for 5-6 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
3. Turn the dough out onto your work surface and shape into a ball. Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray then add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. (To check if the dough has doubled you can press it with your fingertip – if the indentation remains, it’s ready. If the dough springs back, it needs more time.)
4. Spray a 13×9-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
5. Turn the dough out onto your work surface (no need for flour; the dough isn’t sticky). Divide the dough into 16 pieces (if you want to use a scale they’ll each be about 2 ounces). Shape each piece into a ball and transfer to the prepared pan. Repeat with remaining dough, placing four balls of dough in four rows in the pan.
6. **To make ahead: at this point, you can cover the pan and place the rolls in the refrigerator overnight. The next day just remove the pan from the fridge about 4 hours before you want to bake the rolls. Place the pan in a warm spot and allow the rolls to rise until just about doubled before baking (same temperature and time as below).**
7. If baking immediately: Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for about 30 minutes, or until the rolls have just about doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 F. Remove the plastic wrap and bake the rolls for about 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Enjoy!
