excerpt: "From [Joy of Baking](http://www.joyofbaking.com/barsandsquares/CocoaBrownies.html). These make tender, chewy/fudgy brownies. Dutch processed cocoa makes a very dark, almost black, brownie. These are excellent frosted with the mint frosting from Irish Mist Brownies (but I use only about ¾ of that recipe for one 8-inch x 8-inch pan of brownies). While it's important not to overbake brownies, ours took 30-31 minutes, just a bit longer than the recipe recommends."

## INGREDIENTS
* 10 tablespoons (140 grams) unsalted butter
* 1¼ cups (250 grams) granulated white sugar
* ¾ cup (75 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder *preferably Dutch processed*
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs *room temperature*
* ½ cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup (60 ml) sour cream (full or reduced fat)
* ½ cup (85 grams) semi sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips *optional*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Line the bottom and sides of an 8 inch (20 cm) square pan with aluminum foil or pan-lining paper.
2. In a small saucepan melt the butter (can also melt the butter in the microwave). Remove from heat and pour into a large heatproof bowl. Stir (or whisk) in the sugar and cocoa powder. Whisk in the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, mixing until the batter is nice and shiny.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold this flour mixture into the batter. Finally, fold in the sour cream and chocolate chips.
4. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 28 - 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center has moist crumbs clinging to it. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Then, to make the brownies easier to cut, cover and place in the refrigerator for two hours or until firm. When ready to cut the brownies, lift the aluminum foil out of the pan and, with a sharp knife, cut the brownies.
