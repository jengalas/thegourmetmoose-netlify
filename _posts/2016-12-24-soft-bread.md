## INGREDIENTS
* 500 grams all-purpose flour
* 330 ml luke-warm milk
* 100 ml oil
* 1 (tea?)spoon of sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ cube of yeast or 1 pack of dry yeast

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Mix flour, salt, sugar, yeast and mix lightly, then add lukewarm milk (35-39°C) and oil.
2. Mix on slow speed, then keep increasing speed until you reach maximum and the dough gets firm and sticky.
3. Scrape leftover flour and other ingredients into the bottom of the bowl few times to mix everything.
4. Let the dough rise 30 to 60 minutes in the bowl, covered with a large plate or a clean cloth.
5. Sprinkle flour all over the risen dough and using the scraper, detach it from the bowl, then move it into the baking form or onto a baking sheet.
6. Let the dough rise for another 1-2 hours, make sure it doesn't overflow — if that happens, just move the overflown dough from sides to the top (fold it).
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C, place the dough in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.
8. You can place a heat-resistant bowl of hot water 5 minutes before baking to make the inside humid and bake better quality bread.
9. After 20 minutes of baking test the bread: pierce it diagonally across with long wooden stick and take the stick out — it should be clean of the dough. Otherwise lower the temperature to 150°C and let the bread sit for another 5 minutes and test again. Repeat this 5-minute test until the stick comes out clean.
