excerpt: "This bread also works with 5 ounces of white whole wheat flour plus 10 ounces of all-purpose flour. In that situation I would also consider adding a small amount (1 teaspoon or so) of raw honey to counteract possible bitterness."

## INGREDIENTS
* 15 ounces all-purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon instant or rapid rise yeast
* 1½ teaspoons salt
* 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
* 7 ounces (¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons) warm water
* 3 ounces (¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons) mild-flavored lager
* 1 tablespoon white vinegar
* ¾-1 cup chopped kalamata olives
* 1-2 tablespoons olive oil *optional*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Add flour, yeast, salt and rosemary to a large bowl and stir to mix well.
2. Add water, beer, vinegar, and olive oil (if using), and chopped olives. Mix together, being sure to incorporate all dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. A shaggy ball will form.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 8-18 hours.
4. Turn out risen dough onto a floured counter. Knead gently 10-15 times and shape into a ball. Place on a parchment sling inside a small pan (to help the bread keep its shape during its second rise).
5. Let rise for 2 hours. About one-half hour before the second rise is done, place a Dutch oven with lid into the oven and turn on to 500°F.
6. When the bread is risen, score the top with a sharp blade. Use the parchment sling to place the dough into the Dutch oven, and cover with the lid. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 400°F and bake for 45 minutes. Remove lid and bake about 5 minutes more.
