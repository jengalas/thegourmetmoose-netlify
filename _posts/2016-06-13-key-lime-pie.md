excerpt: "Authentic, tart & sweet, delicious! I use the zest of one lime (without measuring; it's usually just over 1 tablespoon), then juice that lime and add to it enough key lime juice to make the ¾ cup. Do not attempt to cover with foil or plastic wrap for chilling! Save the plastic lid from the pie crust, and cover the pie with it for chilling."
