excerpt: "This recipe comes from [Joy of Baking](http://www.joyofbaking.com/Biscuits.html). Ours came out perfect at 12 minutes. I tried grating frozen butter instead of cutting it into cubes. This would probably work very well on a cool day but it was a challenge on a very hot and humid day. Next time maybe try chilling the biscuits on the sheet after cutting them, just before baking?"

## INGREDIENTS

### Biscuit Dough
* 325 grams (2½ cups) all-purpose flour
* 2½ teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 14 grams (1 tablespoon) sugar _optional_
* ½ cup (113 grams) unsalted butter _cold, cut into small pieces_
* ¾ cup milk
* 1 large egg _lightly beaten_

### Egg Wash
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon milk

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. n a large mixing bowl, sift or whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs (use pastry blender, two knives, or fingertips). Add the milk and slightly beaten egg and stir until just combined. (The texture should be sticky, moist and lumpy.)
3. Place mixture on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough gently until it comes together and is a smooth dough.
4. Roll out dough to about a ½ inch thickness. Cut out biscuits with a lightly floured round cookie cutter. Place on prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with the beaten egg and milk mixture and bake for about 10 - 15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the biscuit comes out clean. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack. Serve warm with butter.
5. Makes about 10 2½ inch biscuits.
