## INGREDIENTS

### Buns
* 12 grams dry (instant) yeast
* 75 grams butter, cubed
* 250 mL milk
* 50 grams white sugar
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1+ teaspoon ground cardamom
* 390 grams all-purpose flour

### Filling

* 1+ teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 90 grams sugar

### Topping
* 1 small egg *beaten*

* Pearl sugar

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place the yeast into a large bowl (I use the mixer).
2. Place butter cubes in milk, and microwave gently to heat milk and melt butter. Mixture should be around 99°F. Pour a little of the butter and milk mixture over the yeast and stir until dissolved.
3. Add the rest of the butter and milk mixure along with the sugar, salt, cardamom and flour. Knead with dough hook 8-10 minutes to develop gluten. Dough should no longer be sticky.
4. Cover bowl with tea towel and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, mix the butter, cardamom, cinnamon and sugar for the filling to a smooth paste.
6. Lightly sprinkle the work surface with flour. Pat dough out and let rest for 5 minutes before rolling. Roll out to 12" x 16" rectangle.
7. Using and offset spatula, spread the filling over the entire surface in an even layer. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and slice into 2 cm strips. Twist the dough, and then form a bun by curling the dough around itself.
8. Please the buns in bun cups (I use Reynolds silver foil cups) on baking trays and allow to rest for another 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400° F.
9. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the buns with the beaten egg. Sprinkle each bun with cardamom and pearl sugar. 
10. Bake at 400°F for about 12 minutes or until golden.
