## INGREDIENTS
* 275g lukewarm water
* 6g yeast
* 7g sugar
* 11g salt
* 15g olive oil
* 410g King Arthur Baking Pizza Flour (+5-10g for hand kneading)

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Combine yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, add water, and whisk to combine.
2. Add olive oil and whisk.
3. Add 410g flour and knead with stand mixer 8-10 minutes. Dough will be quite wet and sticky. Remove from mixer, divide in two, and hand-knead each half for a few turns, using some of the extra flour, until dough loses some of its stickiness. 
4. Place each half in a bowl or container, cover, and let rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours. Refrigerate until ready to make pizza.
5. When ready to bake, preheat oven with pizza stone to 450Â°F. Remove one of the dough balls and place on floured parchment. Roll out to 13"-14" circle, resting as needed for the dough to cooperate. Top and slide onto pizza stone; bake for 10-12 minutes.
