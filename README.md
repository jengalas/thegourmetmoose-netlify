# The Gourmet Moose

Zhanna and Rich use this site to record and share their favorite recipes!

[The Gourmet Moose](https://thegourmetmoose.com)

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator that turns simple Markdown text and Liquid templates into a website. Once the templates are set up, all that's required is to add the recipe text and images, commit the changes, and push to GitHub. Netlify will build the site automatically when a new commit is pushed. No database or expensive web hosting necessary!
